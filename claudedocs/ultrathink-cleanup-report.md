## 🛠️ Actions Taken

### Priority 1: Safe Removals ✅ **COMPLETED**
```bash
✅ Removed .DS_Store files (6 locations)
   - Root directory, way3/, theway_server/, Assets.xcassets/

✅ Removed debug/temporary files:
   - theway_server/src/app_debug.js (debug Express app)
   - theway_server/src/server_debug.js (debug server entry)
   - theway_server/src/socket/handlers_temp.js (mock handlers)
   - theway_server/data/way_game.sqlite.backup (database backup)
```

### Priority 2: Structural Improvements ✅ **COMPLETED**
```bash
✅ Font file organization:
   - Moved ChosunCentennial_otf.otf (11.4MB) from root to way3/Resources/
   - Improved asset organization and project cleanliness
   - Font references unchanged (use family name, not file path)
```

### Priority 3: Development Environment ✅ **COMPLETED**
```bash
✅ Removed Xcode user data:
   - way3.xcodeproj/xcuserdata/ (user-specific settings)
   - Improves repository cleanliness for team collaboration
```

## 📋 Documentation Structure Analysis

### Correctly Organized (No Changes Needed)
- **Root /claudedocs/**: iOS/UI implementation documentation
  - cyberpunk-ui-build-validation-report.md
  - cyberpunk-ui-implementation-summary.md
  - merchantdetailview-improvement-plan.md
  - way3_code_analysis_report.md

- **Server /theway_server/claudedocs/**: Backend API documentation
  - Admin_API_Specifications.md
  - Admin_System_Design.md
  - Implementation_Plan.md
  - Media_Storage_System.md

**Assessment**: Documentation separation is **architecturally correct** - different domains require separate documentation.

## 🔮 Recommendations for Ongoing Maintenance

### 1. Automated Prevention (.gitignore Enhancement)
```gitignore
# Add to .gitignore:
.DS_Store
*/.DS_Store
**/.DS_Store
*.backup
*_debug.js
*_temp.js
xcuserdata/
```

### 2. Development Workflow Improvements

**Pre-commit Hooks**:
- Automatically remove .DS_Store files
- Check for debug/temp file patterns
- Validate asset organization

**Regular Maintenance Schedule**:
- Monthly: Scan for accumulated system files
- Quarterly: Review TODO markers for completion
- Semi-annually: Full project structure assessment

### 3. Code Quality Monitoring

**Import Analysis**: Monitor for unused imports during development
**Component Growth**: Track component file sizes (alert if >800 lines)
**TODO Management**: Regular review and prioritization of TODO markers

### 4. Asset Management Best Practices

**Font Management**: All fonts in Resources/ directory
**Image Assets**: Use Xcode asset catalogs consistently
**Documentation**: Maintain separation between client/server docs
